# ultrapivot
UltraPivot.js is a JavaScript extension over PivotTable.js and inpired by SubTotal.js which renders rows and columns of a pivot table with subtotals and lets the user expand or collapse rows and columns.

UltraPivot.js is further extension on the same which provides you more styling like font, foreground and background colors of the data and most importantly has scrolls over the data table which lets you scroll row headers and column headers in sync. 

You will still be able to do all the stuff which PivotTable.js and SubTotal.js provide right through UltraPivot and with same options as It’s just an extension over them.

Roadmap of initial features:
	1. Support synced scroll of column header and row header with data keeping headers sticky.
	2. Support default themes like dark/light/material_dark/material_light
	3. Support configurable font formatting.
	4. Support configurable  color formatting.
	5. Support chars in the table like Bar, Line, Area, Shape  Currently this is in development phase and I’ll update the page soon with demos and examples.
