<h2>Featue Roadmap</h2>
<p>UltraPivot.js is a JavaScript extension over <a href="https://pivottable.js.org/examples/" rel="nofollow">PivotTable.js</a> and inspired by <a href="http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal/examples/" rel="nofollow">SubTotal.js</a> which renders rows and columns of a pivot table with subtotals and lets the user expand or collapse rows and columns.</p>

<p>UltraPivot.js is a further extension on the same which provides you more feature rich table with stylings like font, foreground and background colors and most importantly has scrolls over the data table which lets you scroll row headers and column headers in sync.</p>

<p>You will still be able to do all the stuff which <a href="https://pivottable.js.org/examples/" rel="nofollow">PivotTable.js</a> and <a href="http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal/examples/" rel="nofollow">SubTotal.js</a> provide right through UltraPivot and with same options as itâ€™s just an extension over them which itself is extensible.</p>
